LP file reader.
===============

This project explores the functional style of writing parsers described in [Implementing Functional Languages:
a tutorial, by Simon Peyton Jones and David R Lester](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/pj-lester-book/).

The initial goal is to read linear programming problems in the [Xpress LP](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/Xpress-format.htm) format. Maybe one day it will solve them too.
